Game description: 
Create a 2-Player math game where players take turns to answer simple math addition problems. A new math question is generated for each turn by picking two numbers between 1 and 20. The player whose turn it is is prompted the question and must answer correctly or lose a life.

TASK 1 - Extract nouns for classes:
Read the description above again and extract / write down the nouns that you feel could make for important entities (manifested in the form of classes) to contain (encapsulate) logic as part of this app.

NOUNS: (proctor vs answerer)
-players 
-question
-addition
-score
-result
-turn
-lives

TASK 2 - Write roles for each class:
Write out a brief paragraph describing the role that class will play in your app.

Remember that objects are important for two things:
State: Storing data describing themselves (variables)
Behavior: Defining actions that can be performed on them (methods)

Write down the methods for each class while also speaking to the following points:

What information is relevant to each class?
What will they need in order to be initialized?
What public methods will be defined on them?
Furthermore:

Which class will contain the game loop (where each instance of the loop is the other players turn)?
Which class should manage who the current_player is?
Which class(es) will contain user I/O and which will not have any?

TASK 3 - Peer & Mentor Review
